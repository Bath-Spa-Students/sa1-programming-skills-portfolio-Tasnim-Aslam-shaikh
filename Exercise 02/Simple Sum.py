### Steps:
#1. Declare a variable and initialize it with the integer value '8'.
#2. Declare a second variable and initialize it with the integer value '10'.
#3. Declare a third variable that stores the sum of first two numbers.
#4. Print the value of the sum of the sum to the console

#simple sums
#inserting an integer to the first variable
apple = (int(8))

#inserting an integer to the second variable
banana = (int(10))

#inserting both the first and second variable to the third variable
chikoo = (apple + banana)

#print the variable charle
print(chikoo)
